        <h1 class = "confession">To you, With love.</h1>
        <p1 class = "matter">I know that you and I are weird af. That is why I am doing this. Not cuz I am desperate to get some attention or whatever the fuck it is. It is because I admire you. I want to prove that when a guy likes someone, he can put aside his ego and everything just to make that girl happy. </p1>

        <p2 class = "matter">So yeah, You say you don't deserve love just because something bad happened to you. Past is past. Even if you pay $100 trillion, you cannot change it. The only thing you should admit is if you have done it on purpose, it can sometimes be unforgivable. But if you do it without your knowledge or someone did it without your knowledge and bluffing you, it is their mistake. Karma gets them. Your life is precious. You have a very goofy smile. It's fucking cute. This shit feels like a love letter ðŸ’€, but idk you name it.</p2>

        <h2>Remember, YOU ARE LOVED. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO KNOW IT, BUT YOU ARE LOVED SOMEWHERE, DEEP IN SOMEONE'S HEART.</h2>
